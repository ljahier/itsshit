# It's Shit! - itssh.it

It's Shit! allow you to say how shitty our world is! Your school is shitty? Just go on the [school place](http://school.itssh.it/) and rant about it!

## Project

 The idea is to allow anyone to create a **place** by just putting it's address as subdomain (*\<subdomain\>.itssh.it*) and name it the first time they visit it. Places are public so anyone can participate by creating **shits** (a message) and read others shits.
 
  **This isn't just a ranting place full of hate**, messages should be correct (no hate, no racism, ...) and clearly tell what's wrong with something.
  
  Account creation is mandatory to post and **upvote**/**downvote** others' shits. Account is **only a username and a password**, no email, no tracking, no hidden things, just the minimum.
  
  ## Details
  
  The main page domain [itssh.it](http://itssh.it) is the central place listing **places** and allowing account creation.
  
  Each subdomain is a community and contains posts about a subject. For example, [toto.itssh.it](http://toto.itssh.it) is a place **to shit** about *toto* and contains everything about it.
  
  Posts can be upvoted, downvoted or reported. I'm thinking about commenting but it's not the first purpose of the site.
  
  Integration of images and videos is also an idea for future improvement.
  
  project developed in nodejs with express, express-handlebars, express-subdomain and mysql. You can upgrade and use postegreSQL.
